You can point custom domain names to your Windows Azure web sites. Windows Azure must verify that you are authorized to configure the custom domain name to point to your Windows Azure web site. To verify authorization, create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points from either www.yourdomain.com to codingwizardry.azurewebsites.net, or from awverify.www.yourdomain.com to awverify.codingwizardry.azurewebsites.net. When using Traffic Manager, create a CNAME resource record with your DNS provider that points to the *.trafficmanager.net URL.
